# Web Scraping and KPI Dashboard Automation

## Project Overview
This project scrapes data from a website, processes it into a CSV file, and generates a KPI dashboard PDF. The setup includes automation for periodic execution.

## Instructions to Run
1. Install dependencies: `pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas matplotlib `.
2. Run the scripts:
   - Web Scraper: `python web_scraper.py`. The script scrapes quotes from multiple pages (up to 10) from the website, collects the quote text, author, and associated tags, and saves them into both CSV and JSON formats.

   - KPI Dashboard: `python kpi_dashboard.py`.

## Libraries Used
- `requests` for web scraping.
- `bs4` for HTML parsing.
- `pandas` for data manipulation.
- `matplotlib` for visualization.

## Automation
- Task Scheduler or cron details included.
